**Points to rememeber**:
  a. CPU can do 10^8 computations in a sec. 
  b. If we use a = defaultdict(list) in place of a = {}, then during appending any new value to any key, in that case we dont need to check wheter the key exist or not it will directly add itself.
  c. sorted('string') -> this keyword make a list of sorted charachters of a string, thats why sorted can be use for any literable like tuples, dict, list etc. because it make new memory and store in it. while .sort() only applicable to list and it do things in place.
